# Core Automation

CoWork OS now treats always-on automation as a strict core runtime, not a blended product story.

## Core Boundary

The core runtime is only:

- `Memory`
- `Heartbeat`
- `Subconscious`

Everything else is a surrounding surface:

- `Mission Control` is the cockpit for observing and configuring the core
- `Triggers` are ingress and signal normalization only
- `Devices` are execution routing only
- `Digital Twins` are optional persona presets and are not part of core ownership

## Ownership Model

Core automation is owned by `AutomationProfile`, not by persona templates and not by raw role editing.

An automation profile is attached to a generic operator agent role and stores:

- enabled state
- cadence
- stagger offset
- dispatch cooldown
- dispatch budget
- active hours
- heartbeat profile

Digital Twin roles do not own automation profiles and do not create heartbeat or subconscious state when activated.

## Cognition Path

The intended flow is:

`signal or evidence -> heartbeat -> subconscious -> decision -> downstream surface`

Downstream surfaces can create visible work, but they do not become cognition owners themselves.

## Core Targets

Direct subconscious ownership is intentionally narrow:

- `global`
- `workspace`
- `agent_role`
- `code_workspace`
- `pull_request`

Non-core concepts such as triggers, schedules, briefings, mailbox threads, and devices can still contribute evidence or execute outcomes, but they are not direct cognition targets.

## Mission Control

Mission Control is the main control surface for the core runtime. It should be read as:

- automation profile state
- heartbeat runs
- subconscious runs
- core traces
- failure clusters
- eval cases
- experiments
- learnings

It is not the owner of runtime state; it is the operating cockpit around that state.

## Core Harness

Core automation now includes a learning loop built around:

- core traces
- memory extraction and distillation
- failure mining
- recurring failure clustering
- living eval cases
- gated experiments
- promoted learnings

This gives the always-on runtime a narrow improvement loop centered on operator quality, rather than a broad feature sprawl.

## Approval Model

Core-created automated tasks now inherit a real autonomy policy instead of only `allowUserInput: false`.

The default posture is:

- autonomous execution for routine operator work
- auto-approval for common automation-safe actions such as shell commands and trusted network/external-service operations
- hard guardrails, workspace capability denials, and explicit dangerous actions still remain enforced
